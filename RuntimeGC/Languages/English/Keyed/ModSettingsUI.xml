	<SettingsMMCategory>Memory Monitor</SettingsMMCategory>
	<SettingsMMBarLabel>Visualize memory usage percentage</SettingsMMBarLabel>
	<SettingsMMBarTip>The RuntimeGC tab will be filled with a bar to indicate how many percent of the memory is occupied, similar to  the Research tab. You can further specify an interval you wish to monitor.

*Note: The memory usage shown here is the .NET VM working set of RimWorld, which is the space currently used by program codes. Unity framework and bulk game assets use unmanaged memory out of .NET VM, so they are not counted here (but occupy a stable portion of memory). Both part contributes to the total memory usage shown in taskmgr.exe.
This memory usage also helps to indicate overall game performance and monitor possible dead loops or memory leaks. </SettingsMMBarTip>
	<SettingsMMTipLabel>Append memory usage to the tooltip</SettingsMMTipLabel>
	<SettingsMMTipTip>Memory usage will be added into the tooltip, hover your mouse to inspect.
