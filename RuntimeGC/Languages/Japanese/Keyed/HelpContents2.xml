Close All Letters:
	All letters will disappear as if you dismissed every of them! The lazier the better!

Unlock Normal Speed Limit:
	Unlock the arbitrary Normal Speed limit brought by large threats or assaults. Note this will not permanently disable the speed limit and you will have to unlock it again the next time a limit is triggered. (And it's designed for skipping the march before engage, not for bypassing speed limit during the whole battle)

Change RuntimeGC Settings:
	Bring up Mod Settings page (vanilla page, if you enabled HugsLib).
