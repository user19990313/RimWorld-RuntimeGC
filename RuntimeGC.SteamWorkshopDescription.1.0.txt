PS2. Sometimes errors occur like "Tried to remove xxx from RimWorld.WorldPawns,but it's not here."They're unavoidable as I should thouroughly de-register every pawn(to avoid further bugs).But,[b]they're harmless,so just ignore them.[/b]
PS3. Post any errors or bugs here or on my forum page.Your effort contributes to a better mod.Thanks!
